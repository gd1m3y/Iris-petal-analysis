# This project is a collection of machine and deeplearning models used to classify the iris-petal species 
# Some models used are.
    - Deep neural nets
    - random forest
    - XGB boost 
    - Regression trees
### Tech

Our project utilizes many different librabries to achieve our end goal

* [Python] - the core language 
* [google-colab] - online notebook editor by google ofc
* [pytorch] - For DEEP LEARNING
* [Seaborn] - For Visualization 



### Todos

 - Add more models
 - Add better visualizations
